# Aquam Contra Felis

Authors: Jacob Hellenbrand and Redding Sauter

Aquam Contra Felis is latin for water versus cat, in the game we created which is a spin off of "Balloons Tower Defense" and is a play on cats hate water. 

Run the main class at the top of TowerDefense.java to play the game. A canvas window will open up allowing the user to set towers around the map to defend the end goal of the map. As well a user is given a set amount of lives of which they have, after they lose all of them the game ends. The goal of the game is to strategically place towers and upgrade them to be able to survive as long as possible. Users get a set amount of 300 per round they have successfully defended to add to their bank. 

We referenced the original Balloons Tower Defense game for the ideas of having different types of towers with different ranges and attacks, and as well as being able to upgrade them to make them better. The map was our creation but had some inspirations from the original game as well being it allows for towers to have a lot of area in which they can defend. 

There are a few known issues to be aware of. Currently towers are prevented from being placed in the direct center of the path but can go about half way currently. As well click a tower and not successfully dragging it out of the blue management screen will cause a visual defect of the tower placing. No balance will be subtracted and the tower will not shoot. It really just is visually displeasing. As well the game will begin to slow down once you get to later rounds. This is due from such a large amount of animation occuring our computers have a hard time running.
